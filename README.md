# Brewing Stand keeps fuel

> A Minecraft 1.16.x data pack that stores the brewing stand's fuel when mined with Silk Touch.

## Installation

Download the latest release from [here][latest] and put the datapack zip file into the `datapacks` folder of your Minecraft world.

## Note

Items with different fuel level won't stack anymore. Brewing stands with the same fuel level are stackable. If you do not want to keep the fuel level, just use a normal pickaxe.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the datapack, run the `zerotask:brewing_stand_keeps_fuel/uninstall` function and remove the datapack from your world save. Afterwards, run `reload`.

## License

The data pack is licensed under the GPLv3. For more information, take a look at the license file within this repository.
